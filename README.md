# AWS Jenkins-Docker Infrastructure Automation

This project demonstrates automating the infrastructure provisioning and configuration of Jenkins and Docker servers on AWS using Terraform and Ansible. The goal is to launch and configure two EC2 instances: one for Jenkins and one for Docker.

Project Overview
1. Launch two EC2 instances in AWS: One instance will serve as the Jenkins server, and the other will host Docker.
2. Install Terraform on Jenkins server: We'll use Terraform to automate infrastructure provisioning.
3. Configure AWS CLI and Ansible: AWS CLI is used to interact with AWS services, and Ansible is used for configuration management.
4. Use Terraform to define and launch servers: We define the infrastructure as code using Terraform.
5. Install software with Ansible: Finally, we use Ansible to install necessary software packages and dependencies on both servers.

Task-1: Installing Terraform onto Anchor Server.
Once the Anchor EC2 server is up and running, SSH into the machine using MobaXterm or Putty with the username ubuntu and do the following:

```sudo hostnamectl set-hostname CICDLab```

```bash```

```sudo apt update```

```sudo apt install wget unzip -y```

```wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.9.5/terraform_1.9.5_linux_amd64.zip```

View the Terraform's Latest Versions

```unzip terraform_1.9.5_linux_amd64.zip```

```ls```

```sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin```

```terraform -v```

Now remove zip file
```rm terraform_1.9.5_linux_amd64.zip```

Task 2: Install Python 3, pip, AWS CLI, and Ansible
In this task, I have installed Python 3, pip, AWS CLI, and Ansible to configure and manage AWS resources.

Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Install Python 3 and pip
First, I updated the package list and installed Python 3 and pip using the following commands:

```sudo apt-get update```
